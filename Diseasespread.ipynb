    "So now we have a data frame where we can infect an initial set of students. And watch the disease spread. So the method for this is. At T = 12 (skips teething problems of calender), infect 1% of students with one of 5 diseases A, B, C, D or E. If a student is not infected with a disease, their disease state should be 0. If they are infected with a disease, it should be the capital letter of the disease. Once the student is recovered, their disease state should be the lower case equivalent letter. I'm planning on using a SIR model for each timestep, where the local connection are the students that are co-spatial at that shared time. Begin by producing a Disease class with parameters: transmission rate (between 0 and 1), and recovery rate (likelihood of healing in that hour). Loading Location_popularity.csv provides every location with the number of people you a student comes in contact with while at that location in a given hour. Code up this disease class, and provide a SIR model framework -> moving from time step to time step, updating the assoicated disease column with the correct code. \n",
